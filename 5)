To perform these `systemctl` operations in Ansible, you can use the `ansible.builtin.systemd` module, which allows you to manage services on your system. Below are examples of how each `systemctl` command can be translated into an Ansible playbook task.

### 1. **View detailed information about a unit state**
```yaml
- name: View status of a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    state: started
  register: service_status

- debug:
    var: service_status
```

### 2. **Stop a service on a running system**
```yaml
- name: Stop a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    state: stopped
```

### 3. **Start a service on a running system**
```yaml
- name: Start a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    state: started
```

### 4. **Restart a service on a running system**
```yaml
- name: Restart a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    state: restarted
```

### 5. **Reload the configuration file of a running service**
```yaml
- name: Reload a service configuration
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    state: reloaded
```

### 6. **Completely disable a service from being started, both manually and at boot**
```yaml
- name: Mask a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    masked: yes
```

### 7. **Make a masked service available**
```yaml
- name: Unmask a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    masked: no
```

### 8. **Configure a service to start at boot time**
```yaml
- name: Enable a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    enabled: yes
```

### 9. **Disable a service from starting at boot time**
```yaml
- name: Disable a service
  ansible.builtin.systemd:
    name: UNIT
    enabled: no
```

### 10. **List units required and wanted by the specified unit**
You would need a command task here since Ansible doesn't directly expose listing dependencies:
```yaml
- name: List service dependencies
  ansible.builtin.command: "systemctl list-dependencies UNIT"
  register: result

- debug:
    var: result.stdout
```

These tasks can be added to your Ansible playbooks to manage services using `systemctl` commands in an automated way. Replace `UNIT` with the actual name of the service.
