Hereâ€™s how you can automate the tasks related to file systems, mount points, and file searching using Ansible playbooks:

### 1) Display File Systems and Mount Points
To use the `df` and `lsblk` commands for viewing file systems and mount points, use the `ansible.builtin.command` module:

```yaml
- name: Display file systems and mount points
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Display file systems and mount points
      ansible.builtin.command: df

    - name: Display file systems in human-readable format
      ansible.builtin.command: df -h

    - name: Show disk usage for /var/log
      ansible.builtin.command: du -h /var/log

    - name: List details of block devices
      ansible.builtin.command: lsblk

    - name: List block devices with full paths, UUIDs, and mount points
      ansible.builtin.command: lsblk -fp
```

### 2) Mount and Unmount File Systems
To mount and unmount file systems, use `ansible.builtin.mount`:

```yaml
- name: Manage mount points
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Mount the /dev/vdb1 partition on /mnt/data
      ansible.builtin.mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        src: /dev/vdb1
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted

    - name: Unmount the /mnt/data directory
      ansible.builtin.mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        state: unmounted
```

### 3) Search for Files
To perform file searches, use `ansible.builtin.command` to run `find` and `locate`:

```yaml
- name: Search for files based on various criteria
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Search for files with "passwd" in the name
      ansible.builtin.command: locate passwd

    - name: Perform a case-insensitive search for "messages"
      ansible.builtin.command: locate -i messages

    - name: Find files owned by the chrony user in /var/lib
      ansible.builtin.command: sudo find /var/lib -user chrony

    - name: Find files in /var owned by root and group owner mail
      ansible.builtin.command: sudo find /var -user root -group mail

    - name: Find files larger than 50 KB in /usr/bin
      ansible.builtin.command: find /usr/bin -size +50k

    - name: Find files in /home/student not changed in the last 120 minutes
      ansible.builtin.command: find /home/student -mmin +120

    - name: List all block device files in /dev
      ansible.builtin.command: find /dev -type b
```

### Explanation
- **File Systems and Mount Points**: The `df` and `du` commands show disk usage, while `lsblk` lists block devices.
- **Mount/Unmount Operations**: The `ansible.builtin.mount` module is used to mount and unmount partitions.
- **File Searching**: The `find` and `locate` commands allow you to locate files based on name, ownership, size, modification time, etc.

Using these playbooks, you can automate file system and storage device management, as well as file search operations, to streamline tasks across multiple hosts.
