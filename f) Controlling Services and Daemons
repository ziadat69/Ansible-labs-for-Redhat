In Ansible, you can manage services using the `systemd` module, which allows you to perform tasks similar to those you've listed with `systemctl`. Hereâ€™s how you can use Ansible to manage systemd services:

1. **View detailed information about a unit state**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Get detailed information about a unit state
     ansible.builtin.command: systemctl status UNIT
     register: unit_status

   - debug:
       var: unit_status.stdout
   ```

2. **Stop a service on a running system**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Stop a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       state: stopped
   ```

3. **Start a service on a running system**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Start a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       state: started
   ```

4. **Restart a service on a running system**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Restart a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       state: restarted
   ```

5. **Reload the configuration file of a running service**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Reload a service's configuration
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       state: reloaded
   ```

6. **Completely disable a service from being started, both manually and at boot**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Mask a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       masked: yes
   ```

7. **Make a masked service available**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Unmask a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       masked: no
   ```

8. **Configure a service to start at boot time**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Enable a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       enabled: yes
   ```

9. **Disable a service from starting at boot time**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Disable a service
     ansible.builtin.systemd:
       name: UNIT
       enabled: no
   ```

10. **List units required and wanted by the specified unit**:
    ```yaml
    - name: List dependencies of a unit
      ansible.builtin.command: systemctl list-dependencies UNIT
      register: dependencies

    - debug:
        var: dependencies.stdout
    ```

Replace `UNIT` with the actual service name, like `nginx` or `httpd`. This setup will enable you to manage services with Ansible similarly to how you would with `systemctl`.
